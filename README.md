Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing:
  Definition: Unit testing focuses on verifying the functionality of individual components or modules of a software application in isolation. Typically, developers perform these tests       during the coding phase to ensure that each unit operates as intended.​
  Importance: By isolating each part of the program, unit testing facilitates early detection of defects, simplifies debugging, and enhances code quality. It also supports code               reusability and simplifies integration by ensuring that each unit functions correctly before being combined with others.
System Testing:
  Definition: System testing assesses the complete and fully integrated software product to verify that it meets specified requirements. It encompasses a range of tests, including           functional and non-functional aspects like performance, usability, and security.​
  Importance: Conducting system testing validates the end-to-end system specifications and ensures that the software behaves as intended in a production-like environment. It helps           detect defects that may not have been identified during unit or integration testing, providing confidence in the system's readiness for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective inputs, known as prompts, to guide artificial intelligence (AI) models toward generating desired responses.
Importance:
 Enhanced Output Quality: Well-structured prompts lead to more accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate AI-generated content. The effectiveness of the output heavily depends on     how well we communicate with the model via prompts.

 Improved User Experience: By guiding AI models to generate more relevant and personalized responses, prompt engineering contributes to more efficient and satisfying long-term               interactions with AI systems.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example:
Vague Prompt:
  "Write about social media marketing."​
  Issue: This prompt is too broad and lacks direction, potentially leading to a general or unfocused response.​
Improved Prompt:
  "Create a guide on Instagram marketing strategies for small businesses in 2025, focusing on Reels and Stories."
Why is it most  effective.
  Specific Platform: By specifying "Instagram," the AI can tailor its response to strategies relevant to that platform.​
  Target Audience: Identifying "small businesses" helps focus the advice on strategies suitable for that demographic.
  Time Frame: Mentioning "2025" encourages the inclusion of up-to-date trends and projections.​
  Content Focus: Highlighting "Reels and Stories" directs the AI to concentrate on these particular features, ensuring a more detailed and useful response.
